# Linux4
## Main Objective
In this lesson there's a series of 3 zipping utilities that have obfuscated a file in this directory
- gunzip
- zip
- tar

You will have to use context clues provided by the 'file' command as well as the file extensions provided in order to try to correctly decompress the file.
## Secondary objective
There is a hidden file in this folder as well. If you set it to be executable and then run the file, it will run the file!
